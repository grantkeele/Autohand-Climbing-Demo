# Autohand-Climbing-Demo
A demonstration of the VR climbing system I designed around Earnest Robot's Autohand package

Download ClimbingDemoScene.unitypackage and open it in Unity. It contains an obstacle course scene with the fully working climbing system attached to various parts of the player. Have fun decyphering my spaghetti code :)
